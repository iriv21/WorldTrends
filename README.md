# WorldTrends
Analyzation of world birth rates and life expectancy from world regions in the years of 1960 to 2013.


This data was represented with Seaborn visualizations, an imported library using Python.  
The data was cleaned, then organized and modeled with scatterplots, as we would want to 
show the relationships between regions and life expectancies. The final report has a summary
and explains the trends, outliers, and relationships.
